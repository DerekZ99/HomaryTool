Or another way is that you can screw off the connector (at the ball joint) to see there is a white part inside which is the LED generator.\n\nBesides, the generator will get power from water flow to generate electricity to make LED bulbs light up. Namely the LED light will be activated once the water is turned on. But please DON'T try to do anything to the LED generator (i.e pull it out) which may damage LED function.\n\nIf the LED lights haven't lighted up ever after installation, it may have something to do with the water pressure. As you know, LED function on the shower head is powered by water flow, and the minimum water pressure it requires is 0.1 MPa/1 bar. Namely, if the water pressure at your home is high enough to power the LED, they will light up once you turn on the water. So if it is the case, you may first have a check whether the water pressure is good enough. If not, you may consider connecting it to the main water supplies or further add a pump to gain enough water pressure.?\n\nOr if the water pressure at your home is good but the LED just doesn't work, please kindly take a video to help us learn about the problem clearly. After confirming the problem, we will work out a solution for you as soon as possible.\n\nThanks a lot for your time and effort in advance.

As I have mentioned, the tax threshold in the UK is extremely low, only about ?15, however, those countries like the USA whose tax threshold is US$200, which is far more higher, we can easily keep the declared value in the tax-free amount.

We also offer free shipping/delivery to those counties and customs fees also need to be managed by themselves, just we are able to keep it in the tax-free amount due to their customs policy.
